# Autonomous DevOps Agent — Consolidated Documentation

This repository contains an Autonomous DevOps Agent built for the RIFT 2026 Hackathon. The agent automates repository analysis, test execution, failure classification, fix generation, and CI/CD monitoring. The repository includes a React dashboard and a Node.js backend that orchestrates agent workflows.

Overview

The Autonomous DevOps Agent performs the following high-level steps for a submitted repository:

- Clone the repository
- Detect language and test frameworks
- Run tests inside a sandboxed environment
- Classify test failures using AI
- Generate and apply patches where appropriate
- Commit and push fixes to a new branch
- Monitor CI/CD and iterate until success or retry limit
- Export run results as `results.json` for analysis or scoring

Live deployment

- Frontend (React dashboard): update deployment URL in this README when available.
- Backend (Agent API): update deployment URL in this README when available.

Demo video guidance

See `docs/LINKEDIN_VIDEO.md` for a full checklist and script. The video should show a short run, architecture overview, and final dashboard results. Ensure the post is public and includes repository and deployment links.

Features

- Autonomous analysis and repair workflow
- Multi-language support: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python (basic Java support)
- Bug classification and patch generation using AI
- Git integration for branch creation and commits
- Sandboxed test execution using Docker
- Results export and dashboard visualization

Tech stack

Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

Backend: Node.js 18, Express, Prisma, MySQL, OpenAI SDK, simple-git, Docker

Installation

Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Docker (recommended for sandboxed test runs)
- MySQL 8+ (or compatible SQL database)

Backend (development)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. Create environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit backend/.env: set DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, JWT_SECRET, GITHUB_TOKEN (if needed)
```

3. Prisma / database

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:generate   # Generates Prisma client
npm run db:migrate    # Runs migrations (development)
```

4. Start backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev           # nodemon src/server.js
# or for production: npm run prod
```

Frontend (development)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

2. Configure frontend env

```bash
cd Frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_API_URL (e.g. http://localhost:5000) and VITE_USE_REAL_BACKEND
```

3. Start frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

Build frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run build
```

Docker

See `docker-compose.yml` for a recommended composition. Docker is recommended for running the sandboxed test runner and database in isolation.

Environment

Key backend variables (defaults in `backend/src/config/index.js`):

- `DATABASE_URL` — MySQL connection string, e.g. `mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/devops_agent` (required)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI API key used by the agent (required for real fixes)
- `JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing secret (change for production)
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` — Token expiry (default `7d`)
- `PORT` — Backend port (default `5000`)
- `FRONTEND_URL` — Frontend origin allowed for CORS (default `http://localhost:5173`)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — Required for authenticated Git operations on private repos
- `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASS`, `MAIL_FROM`, `MAIL_PORT` — Optional SMTP settings
- `AGENT_RETRY_LIMIT` — Agent iteration limit (default `5`)

Frontend env

- `VITE_API_URL` — Backend URL
- `VITE_USE_REAL_BACKEND` — `true` or `false` (simulation/demo mode)

Security notes

- Never commit secrets to source control. Use secret management offered by hosting platforms.

Usage

From the dashboard (default `http://localhost:5173`):

1. Paste repository URL
2. Enter team name and leader name
3. Click Run Agent

Expected workflow

- Clone repository
- Analyze and detect tests/failures
- Run tests in Docker sandbox
- Classify failures and generate candidate fixes
- Commit and push changes to a new branch
- Monitor CI/CD and iterate until success or retry limit
- Download `results.json` from the dashboard for submission

API examples

- `POST /api/agent/run` — Protected. Triggers an agent run for a repository.
- `POST /api/auth/register` — Register user.
- `POST /api/auth/login` — Login and obtain JWT.
- `GET /health` — Health check endpoint.

Known limitations

1. Private repo operations require `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. AI-generated fixes are not guaranteed; complex fixes may need manual review.
3. Large repositories may take longer; use small-to-medium repos for demos.
4. Language support is optimized for JS/TS and Python.

4. **Performance:**
   - Large repositories (>1000 files) may take 5-10 minutes
   - OpenAI API rate limits may affect speed

5. **Language Support:**
   - Best performance with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
   - Java support is basic

6. **Docker Requirement:**
   - Production deployment requires Docker for sandboxing
   - Local dev can run without Docker (less secure)
